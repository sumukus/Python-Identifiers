# Python-Identifiers
This is my first attempt to carry out the empirical study on python identifiers. I wanted to know how the identifiers name are used in the python code. What are the different lenghts of identifiers name used in python code? Is there any relevence between the repository name and the identifiers name used inside the repository?

#Dependencies Installation
I have used spiral module for splitting the identifiers name into its atomic form or tokens.
It can be access from the github repository called [spiral](https://github.com/casics/spiral)
